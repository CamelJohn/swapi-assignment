# Usage

```
  npm i
  
  npm run dev
```

This will spin up a nodeJS server and a React Client. It might be a little slow. please be patient with me.

The Client will shortly open up in the browser (if for some reason it does not, go to localhost:3000).

I'm no frontend developer, and I got stressed and was not sure about the scope of the assignment.

I know i could of dont the whole thing in the frontend, but it seemed incorrect and messy to me.

Had I not stressed out I would have:
- written tests in `jest` for the `node` code (full dissclosure, I have never written a test for a `react` component before, and now was not the time to learn how).

- spun up two seperate Docker containers and hooked them up with docker-compose.

- added typescript to `node` & `react`

Hope you like my assignment !

Cheers !!!
